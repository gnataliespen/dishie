# Dishie


## Description
Dishie is a web application for adding, sharing, and managing recipes and recipe ingredients. Users may upload their own recipes, or save others' recipes. The primary data type stored in each recipe is the recipe's ingredients. These ingredients can be used to autopopulate a user's grocery list. (coming soon...)

Dishie is built in NodeJS and Express, and uses a MongoDB database.

## Some key features:
<ul>
  <li>Users can Log in with google.</li>
  <li>Users can comment on and save recipes they like</li>  
  <li>Users can post there own recipes and Dishie will format the ingredients data to be easily manipulated.
