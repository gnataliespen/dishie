# Dishie


## Description
Dishie is a web application for adding, sharing, and managing recipes and recipe ingredients. Users may upload their own recipes, or save others' recipes. The primary data type stored in each recipe is the recipe's ingredients. These ingredients can be used to autopopulate a user's grocery list. (coming soon...)

Dishie is built in NodeJS and Express, and uses a MongoDB database.

## Some key features:
Users can Log in with google.
Users can comment on and save recipes they like
Users can post there own recipes and Dishie will format the ingredients data to be easily manipulated.

## Usage
Currently dishie is just for finding recipes, but in the future you will also be able to meal plan, and build a grocery list on the site.

## Roadmap
Improve UI by making the application 'lighter'.
Add grocery list
improve error handling
Add Meal 
Improve user experience for adding ingredients to recipes.

## Contributing
Dishie is still in beta so if you notice something wrong, please open up an issue on the repo. 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
