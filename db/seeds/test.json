        {
          "ingredient": "1/2 cup white wine"

        {
          "ingredient": "1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary"

          "ingredient": "1 recipe Hot Water Crust (https://food52.com/recipes...)"
        }
      ],
      "directions": [
        {
          "step": "In a large pot, heat the pancetta over medium heat. Cook until the fat has rendered and it’s golden brown, 5-6 minutes."
        },
        {
          "step": "Add the shallots and sauté until tender, 2-3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute more."
        },
        {
          "step": "Add the kale in batches—adding handfuls and sautéing until it wilts. Once all the kale is added, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes."
        },
        {
          "step": "Add the wine to the pan and sauté until it evaporates, 6-8 minutes. Stir in the rosemary."
        },
        {
          "step": "Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, 5-6 minutes more. Stir in the walnuts."
        },

          "step": "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a 9 inch springform pan on it."

          "step": "Prepare the Hot Water Crust as directed by the recipe, then divide into two pieces—one about 2/3 of the dough (for the base and sides) and one about 1/3 of the dough (for the top)."
        },
        {
          "step": "Start with the larger piece for the base and sides. Remember, you have to work with the crust while it’s hot to keep it pliable. I like to roll it out as best I can between two sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/4 inch thick (a little thicker is OK, too)."
        },
        {
          "step": "Peel the top piece of plastic wrap off, then use the bottom piece to help you invert the dough into the springform pan. Don’t worry if it tears or small holes appear—you can patch it! Patch any holes, tears, or uncovered areas with more dough, and press well to ensure they’re sealed. (Alternatively, you can just press the crust in from the get go— just remember to work quickly!)"
        },
        {
          "step": "Pour the filling into the pan and spread into an even layer. Transfer the springform pan back to the parchment lined baking sheet."
        },
        {
          "step": "Roll out the remaining dough between two sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/4 inch thick. Peel off the top piece of plastic wrap then use the bottom piece to help you invert the crust on top of the filling, then peel it away."
        },
        {
          "step": "Pinch the two crusts together at the sides, and pinch off any excess. Crimp the edges as desired to make sure they’re sealed together."
        },
        {
          "step": "Use the handle of a wooden spoon to make a vent in the center of the pie. Bake the pie until the crust is golden brown and steam is coming out of the vent, 40-45 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before unmolding, slicing, and serving."

      "description": "Spoon these chestnuts—roasted with similarly earthy-sweet fennel seeds—over ice cream or oatmeal or (my favorite) tangy yogurt. They're melty, rich, a little chewy, and the buttery, chestnutty sauce is the best part. Roast them in a parchment paper bag and not only do you have approximately zero things to clean up, but it's also super easy to collect the syrup they roast in.\nAlso: Jarred chestnuts are great! No need to roast and peel your own, though you're certainly more than welcome to. Just make sure to get ones that are packed in water (or are vacuum-packed) rather than in syrup. —Caroline Lange",
      "ingredients": [
        {
          "ingredient": "1 14.8-oz. jar roasted, peeled chestnuts (or about 1 pound chestnuts you've roasted and peeled yourself)"

          "step": "Add the butter, maple syrup, fennel seeds, vanilla bean seeds (I like to include the bean itself, too—it's pretty, and holds vanilla flavor itself), salt, and water to the bag. Seal or pinch the bag closed and slide into the preheated oven."
        },
        {
          "step": "After 5 minutes, carefully use tongs to give the bag a good shake, distributing the (now melted) butter with the chestnuts and spices. Roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the chestnuts have softened a bit."
        },
        {
          "step": "Remove the pan and let rest 5 or so minutes before opening. Taste for salt and add a pinch more, if you like. Pour the chestnuts and sauce into a bowl and serve immediately (especially over tangy yogurt or vanilla ice cream!) or pack into a jar and refrigerate for up to a week."
        },
        {
          "step": "To reheat the chestnuts, warm in a pan over very low heat with a splash of water, tossing them often."

      "description": "Here’s an easy ultra chocolaty drop cookie laced with chips or chunks of any kind of chocolate you like—white, milk, or dark. Follow the slightly quirky mixing instructions and take cookies out of the oven when they are still soft to the touch; they will firm up as they cool and but remain moist slightly gooey. —Alice Medrich",

Add the flour mixture and stir until you can no longer see it. Stir the batter vigorously with a wooden spoon or spatula until it is smooth and shiny and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. It may start to slide around the bowl as you stir—just keep stirring until it is thick and cohesive and no longer slides in the bowl. Stir for a few more seconds for good measure. Be sure the batter is completely cool to the touch, and then stir in the nuts and chocolate pieces."

Scoop all of the batter onto the parchment sheets right away, rather than letting it wait in the bowl, even if you are baking later. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until the cookies are puffed and a little crackled on the surface and feel soft and tender—but not squishy— when touched with a fingertip. Rotate the sheets from upper to lower and front to back about halfway through the time to insure even baking. The cookies will firm up as they cool."
